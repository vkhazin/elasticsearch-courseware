* Eliminates 'works on my machine' by escaping matrix dependencies
* Run applications side-by-side with predictable and portable deployments
* Achieves higher compute density - unlike VMs only libraries and settings are required
* Maintain immutable and tamper-proof environments, and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/library/hello-world/tags/" target="_blank">docker hub is scanning the images</a>
* Built-in orchestration to scale up to tens of thousands of nodes in seconds using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" _target="_blank">Docker Swarm</a>
