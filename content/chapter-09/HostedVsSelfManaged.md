# Hosted vs Self-Managed #

* Using a self-managed cluster appears cheaper as far as monthly quoted costs go
* Self-managed clusters allows greater control over configuration settings
* Greater control over access to data
* Costs for self-managed option should take operations effort in consideration
* Hosted ElasticSearch is likely operated by ElasticSearch specialists than enterprise operation generalists
* Ideally hosted option eliminates the need for over-planning
* Aws hosted ElasticSearch asks for number and type of ec2 instances to run on
* Bonsai.io pre-sale engineers asking for data volumes and usage patterns instead
* Sample quote from Bonsai.io: $2,950/mo for 1.5TB of raw data coming at 50kbps for index-mostly usage pattern
* Compare that to cost of self-management: hardware and ongoing operation cost
