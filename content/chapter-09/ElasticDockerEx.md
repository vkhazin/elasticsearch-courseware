# ElasticSearch Container Exercise #

* Login into your sandbox
* Shutdown host services to release memory:   
  ```
  sudo service elasticsearch stop
  sudo service kibana stop
  sudo service filebeat stop
  sudo service logstash stop
  ```
* Since previously installed Elastic is running, we will use a different port: 9201 for api
```
 sudo docker run -d -p 9201:9200 -e "http.host=0.0.0.0" -e "transport.host=127.0.0.1" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.4.1
```
* -d: run detached not to take over command prompt
* -e: parameters accepted/expected by the image
* Give it few moments to start and then test:
```
 curl elastic:changeme@localhost:9201
```
* Expected output:
  ```
  {
    "name" : "3kMnHFQ",
    "cluster_name" : "docker-cluster",
    "cluster_uuid" : "E7Ag9a_1SX2FVPsMQGUCng",
    "version" : {
      "number" : "5.4.1",
      "build_hash" : "2cfe0df",
      "build_date" : "2017-05-29T16:05:51.443Z",
      "build_snapshot" : false,
      "lucene_version" : "6.5.1"
    },
    "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
  }
  ```
* Using docker cli to list containers:
  ```
  sudo docker ps -a
  ```
* Expected output is list with two containers: hello-world and elastic
* To stop running container, copy container id to replace in the command below:
  ```
  sudo docker stop 8ed07e81b59c
  ```
* Using docker cli to list containers to confirm none are running:
  ```
  sudo docker ps -a
  ```
* Expected output is a list of two containers previously launched: hello-world and elasticsearch
