# Hardware #

* ElasticSearch built to scale out on commodity hardware not to scale up on monster hardware
* SAN: all nodes will read and write using the same hardware, single point of failure
* SSD vs HDD: same as with many I/O intensive systems - SSD is faster, not safer
* Have not heard of specialty ElasticSearch hardware yet
* There is no specific hardware mentioned in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/hardware.html" target="_blank">ElasticSearch documentation</a>
