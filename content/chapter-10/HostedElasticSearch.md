# Hosted ElasticSearch #

* Number of hosted providers available is growing, maybe reflective of <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=elasticsearch" target="_blank">interest</a>
* Elastic.co acquired Found.io and now offers <a href="https://www.elastic.co/cloud" target="_blank">Elastic stack as a service</a>
* <a href="https://qbox.io/" target="_blank">QBox</a> offers ElasticSearch across multiple <a href="http://status.qbox.io/" target="_blank">cloud providers</a>
* <a href="https://bonsai.io/2015/10/26/bonsai-security" target="_blank">Bonsai.io offers data encrypted at rest for ElasticSearch</a>
* http://www.searchly.com/ - I use it for ElasticSearche proof-of-concepts as it offers free tier
* <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/" target="_blank">Amazon ElasticSearch Service</a> requires AWS subscription, a tad tedious to setup and to connect
