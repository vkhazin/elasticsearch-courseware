# ElasticSearch #

## Description ##
ElasticSearch has fast become a favorite in the realm of data stores over the past few years. It has made the full text search more accessible by broadening its scope. Its intelligent architecture has made the advanced technology of Lucene, which comprises its core, easy to use for any developer. One of the key reasons ElasticSearch has become so popular is its hybridization of full text search engine characteristics with NoSQL principles like automatic sharding, replication, and healing.
